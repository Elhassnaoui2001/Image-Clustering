# **Image Clustering** 
This repository demonstrates image clustering using the K-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithms. The goal is to segment images into distinct regions based on similarity in color or other relevant features.

# **Algorithms Used**
# 1.   **K-means Clustering:**

K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into clusters.
In the context of image clustering, K-means groups pixels based on color similarity.
It iteratively refines cluster assignments and centroids to minimize the sum of squared distances.

# 2. **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC):**

HAC builds a hierarchy of clusters in the form of a dendrogram.
It starts with individual data points as clusters and merges them based on similarity.
Clusters are formed in a hierarchical structure that can be cut at different levels to obtain desired clusters.

# **Repository Contents**

**image_clustering.ipynb:**
Jupyter Notebook containing implementations of both the K-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithms for image clustering.

# **Getting Started**
1. **Clone this repository to your local machine using:** 
**git clone https://github.com/Elhassnaoui2001/Image-Clustering**

2. **Open and run the image_clustering.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to see the image clustering process using both K-means and HAC algorithms.**

3. **Feel free to replace the sample images with your own images for experimentation.**

# **Requirements**

**Python (3.7 or higher)**
**Jupyter Notebook**
**Required libraries (scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.) as mentioned in the notebook.**
